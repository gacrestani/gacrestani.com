I teach students the basics of Biology and science, such as basic instruments (microscope, pipettes, thermocycler, etc) and the Scientific Method (questions, hypothesis, predictions, etc). I am constantly thinking about my teaching phylosophy and didactics. I believe this is working, as students usually express gratitude and enjoynment in my classes.\nTestimonials It helped me understand bio better This course gave me opportunities to feel comfortable in a biology lab setting This course positively supported my learning by giving me the opportunity to learn laboratory skills. I really enjoyed this lab and was supported in my learning. The instructor and assistants were very helpful if I didn’t understand somthing Giovanni did amazing and really helped me understand the course content. He was really patient and helped me get through the course when unexpected circumstances occurred. It was east to follow along and easy to get help if I needed help understanding something. Gio made me feel welcome and overall excited to learn the material Gave helpful answers to questions that furthered my understanding. Everything was well thought out and organized. The lab portion allowed me to understand deeper in the material we learned in lectures. The instructor was very helpful in explaining, directing, and teaching us concepts clearly and easily. Very good lab course that had great scheduling and assignments that made me feel like I was learning crucial information. Activities were amazing, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe that we were able to work with great technology so easily. Instructor contributed a lot to the course, gave insightful comments that helped me better understand the requirements for the course and how to achieve them. Giovanni and the TA\u0026rsquo;s are very good at supporting and educating us TAs help to solve problems Created a welcoming environment for lab. He was very welcoming and nice Explained everything very well and gave clear instructions I really enjoyed how he broke everything down in order to better understand The teacher shows his patient to teach material again for me due to sometimes I did’t get the concept. the class was low source of stress for me and most things were very clear on what was expected of me which helped me manage my time properly Giovanni was always super helpful, very understanding too.

I work with a study system that was created in the 80s, composed of a set of populations that are on a selection treatment for postponed reproduction - we only allow old flies to reproduce. That generates some interesting phenotypes, such as flies with more than double the regular lifespan. Right now, I am looking at the genomics of that adaptation. Hopefully, in understanding the evolutionary dynamics that happened in this system, we can understand a bit more about some fundamental mechanisms of evolution, such as its reproducibility, reversibility, and parallelity.\nPrevious research # iPSC Pipeline # As an undergrad researcher at the Federal University of Santa Catarina, I participated in several projects and playing different roles, from the bioinformatician to the data collector. My most successful project was the development of a bioinformatics workflow to analyise single-cell iPSC RNA-Seq data using a selection of tools to generate different reports. That workflow uses Snakemake and runs on a Docker image. This project was critical for my understanding of both tools.\nLink\nDichotomous Key App # I also developed a HTML/Javascript app to navigate dichotomous keys digitally. Both undergraduate and graduate students use it in systematics classes. That project improved my undertanding of coding to the next level.\nLink\n","date":"2024-07-02","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/research/","section":"Giovanni A.

I am a PhD student at Burke\u0026rsquo;s Lab, Oregon State University, and my work focuses on Evolutionary Biology. Currently, my major project is on the genomics of Drosophila melanogaster populations experimentally evolved for postponed reproduction. I am also deeply passionate about Complexity Sciences, Systems Biology, and Nonlinear Dynamics.\nMy hobbies involve playing games and reading random blogs. I love hiking, grilling, and generally spending time outside. I also enjoy staying home to play games, watch movies, and read random interesting texts. I\u0026rsquo;ve been reading Isaac Asimov\u0026rsquo;s books, following the internal story chronological order.\nMy story # I was born and raised in Videira, Brazil. I had a fantastic childhood at my family\u0026rsquo;s farm, which taught me to respect and admire Nature. I got in touch with computers early in life, which helped me develop a curiosity and passion that will last a lifetime. These two would be the foundation that supports my world passions today.\nMy family ran a business cultivating and selling reforestation trees. I helped with small tasks, like producing spices and miniature roses that my dad would later deliver to florists in my town. That showed me the role of business and taught me to value effort and money, which later would be critical in my choice of starting Engineering and Business degrees, aiming for the startup bloom that was happening at the time.\nI quickly realized that I liked theoretical knowledge and science in general. I was more interested in learning than doing. After reading The Web of Life and On Complexity, I switched my major to Biological Sciences, aiming to study the evolution of complex systems and pursue an academic career.\nI received my Biological Sciences (Licentiate) degree at the Federal University of Santa Catarina, Brazil, in 2022. There, I worked in several different environments, spending time on the bench, the field, and the computer. I participated in distinct projects collecting and preparing water and soil samples for analysis, conducting molecular biology experiments, and building and running bioinformatics workflows. This aggregation of different areas led me to think about science in an interdisciplinary and systemic way.\nNow, I am pursuing my Ph.D. at Oregon State University. My plans involve returning to Brazil and starting my lab at my Alma Mater. I would love to write a book. I am also open to possibilities and may change that in the future.\n","date":"2024-07-02","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"Giovanni A.
